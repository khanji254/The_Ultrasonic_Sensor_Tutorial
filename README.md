# Arduino Sensor Projects

Welcome to the Arduino Sensor Projects repository! This collection features various Arduino projects showcasing the capabilities of ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and LCD displays.

## Projects

### 1. [Arduino Radar](Arduino_Radar.ino)
![Arduino Radar](images/arduino_radar.gif)

**Description:**
The Arduino Radar project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to create a simple radar system. The servo motor sweeps the ultrasonic sensor, detecting objects and displaying their distance on the Serial Monitor.

### 2. [Servo Motor Control](Servo.ino)

**Description:**
The Servo Motor Control project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using Arduino. The code sweeps the servo motor from 0 to 180 degrees and back, creating a sweeping motion. This project is an excellent starting point for servo motor applications.

### 3. [Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement](Ultrasonic_Sensor.ino)

**Description:**
The Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement project focuses on measuring distances using an ultrasonic sensor. The Arduino reads data from the sensor and prints the distance information to the Serial Monitor. This is a fundamental project for working with ultrasonic sensors.

### 4. [Ultrasonic Sensor Tutorial With LCD](Ultrasonic_Sensor_Tutorial_WithLCD.ino)
